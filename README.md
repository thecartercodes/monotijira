# Monotijira

I started this repo because I wanted to achieve the following:

1. Immerse myself in a coding environment while I solve business problems
2. Track the progress of certain tasks, leads, CRM related stuff without having to touch jank like Salesforce
3. Familiarize myself with more Markdown
4. Have my commit history be more green, kek
